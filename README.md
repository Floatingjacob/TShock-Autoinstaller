# TShock-Autoinstaller

HOW TO USE

Windows
1. Download and extract the windows release into an empty folder.
2. run "install.bat" and let it install.
3. after it asks for a world, close the terminal window and double click "TShock.Server.exe"
4. Voilà, now you have the TShock server installed for windows.
Whenever you want to run the server, just open 'TShock.Server.exe' and you should have a terminal window open with the server.

Linux (tested on kali-linux and Debian 12)
1. download and extract the linux release into an empty folder.
2. open up a terminal and navigate to the folder you just extracted.
3. execute "./install" without the quotes.
4. after the terminal asks for a world, do CTRL+C to exit the server.
5. execute "./postinstall" without the quotes
6. Voilà now you have the TShock server installed for linux.
Whenever you want to run the server, just open a terminal in the server folder, and type "./TShock.Serever" without the quotes



NOTE(S)
i do not plan to make a version for macOS because i do not have a mac to test this on. if any of you want a mac version, do it yourself. it is pretty easy. just modify the windows batch file to run on macos and download the mac version of 7zip


This downloads and installs TShock 5.2.1 for Terraria 1.4.4.9. if you want me to update it to use newer versions and i have not already, submit an issue saying to update it.
